### 📝 Project Overview: NYPD Arrest Analysis for Manhattan

This project explores arrest patterns in Manhattan using NYPD arrest data, with a specific focus on demographic and spatial insights. The analysis centers on understanding who is getting arrested, for what types of offenses, and where these incidents are occurring.

#### Key Components:

1. **Age Group Analysis**
   A bar chart visualizes arrest counts across age groups, revealing that the **25–44 age group accounts for the majority of arrests**, followed by 45–64 and 18–24. Arrests among youth (<18) and seniors (65+) are minimal, suggesting a concentration of criminal justice activity among working-age adults.

2. **Offense Type Breakdown**
   Within the 25–44 demographic, another chart breaks down arrests by offense type—**misdemeanors dominate**, with fewer felonies and very few violations. This implies that while serious crimes do occur, **lower-level offenses are significantly more common** among this population.

3. **Geospatial Visualization**
   A scatter map shows the **geographical spread of arrests across Manhattan** for individuals aged 25–44. The data, color-coded by offense level, reveals that **misdemeanors are geographically widespread**, while felonies and violations appear in fewer locations. This reflects the broad occurrence of low-level offenses citywide.

#### Insights:

* The justice system’s burden is heaviest on **working-age adults**, primarily for misdemeanors.
* **Spatial patterns** suggest a borough-wide distribution of low-level crime, with pockets of higher-severity incidents.
* These findings can inform **targeted policy efforts**, such as focused deterrence strategies or community-based interventions for adults in their prime working years.
